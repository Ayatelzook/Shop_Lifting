## 🎥 Data  

### **Input Data**  
The dataset consists of video files in MP4 format, categorized into two classes:  
- **Shoplifting** – Videos showing shoplifting activities.  
- **Non-shoplifting** – Videos showing normal shopping behavior.  

### **Data Preprocessing**  
The preprocessing steps include:  
- **Frame Extraction** – Videos are converted into frames at a fixed frame rate.  
- **Padding and Normalization** –  
    - Videos are padded to max frames if they are shorter.  
    - Pixel values are normalized to the range `[0, 1]`.  
- **Resizing** – Frames are resized to a fixed resolution for consistent input size.
